# Observability of Systemic Risk

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the multi-asset jump-diffusion model used in the paper "[The Observability of Systemic Risk through a Proxy Asset](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383457681_The_Observability_of_Systemic_Risk_through_a_Proxy_Asset)." The model integrates a systemic risk factor with several conditionally independent idiosyncratic factors to estimate the behavior of ordinary assets.

## Contents
- **Model Code**: MATLAB code implementing the multi-asset jump-diffusion model.
- **Testing Files**: R code for testing the model's accuracy and performance using various approaches.
- **Empirical Study Data**: Excel datasets used for the empirical analysis in the paper.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Systemic-Risk-Proxy-Asset.git
   cd Systemic-Risk-Proxy-Asset
